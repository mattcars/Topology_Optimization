# Topology Optimization

The algorithm developed is based off of the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) optimization method outlined in An Introduction to Strucural Optimization by Christensen and Klarbring. The FEA is a custom 2D elastic FEA library (see Finite Element Analysis repository for more information) modified to take in sheet thickness as a parameter.

# Examples: 
- Cantilever (load at bottom corner)
- Cantilever 2 (load at beam center)

# TODO: 
- implement filters
- Create example implementing the MBB beam example
